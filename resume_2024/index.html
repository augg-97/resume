      <p>
        My name is Lê Huy Hoàng! I have 4 years of experience as a full-stack developer. I've been working with NodeJS using the NestJS and ExpressJS frameworks to build microservice applications. I've worked with databases like PostgreSQL, Cassandra, and Neo4J. I also worked with tools like Redis for caching, Google Pub/Sub for async communication, and Docker and K8S for application deployment. I’ve used GitLab CI and GitHub Actions for CI/CD, and some AWS services like S3, SQS, SNS, EKS, ELB, and Lambda.
      </p>
      <p>
        I always want to write code that is readable and maintainable, and I try to learn new knowledge to build systems that are efficient in terms of performance and security.
